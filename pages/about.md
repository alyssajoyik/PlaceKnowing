## About TULIPFEST

Tulipfest is a practice website where Dr. Alyssa Kreikemeier is learning the complicated language of web development (that's a joke, she's hardly learning how to make a website). She is learning this in order to be able to build the repository PlaceKnowing which will archive research and education projects from her teaching and research.

Placeknowing: Studying History through Experiencing Place OR?
Placeknowing: Experiencing Place to Learn about the Past

This demo collection features items from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/), and is build using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).
